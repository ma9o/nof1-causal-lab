# nof1-causal-lab study API — curl skill

The public scientific interface has seven actions: `edit_question`, `edit_model`,
`prepare_data`, `fit`, `simulate`, `data_diff`, and `model_diff`.
Start a call with `POST /api/studies/{workspace_id}/{action}` using
`{action, input, reasoning}`. Each action owns its typed `input`; optional top-level
`reasoning` explains the caller's intent and is excluded from call identity.

POST and polling GET return `{call_id, action, status, commit_id, body, messages}`.
Action responses use `application/msgpack`; requests remain JSON. Python callers
can decode a saved response with `msgpack.unpackb(response_bytes, raw=False)`;
the shared TypeScript client decodes responses automatically. `arrays` entries
carry binary NPY bytes, read with `numpy.load(io.BytesIO(entry["npy"]), allow_pickle=False)`
in Python or `readNumericalArray(entry)` in TypeScript. NPY retains dtype, shape,
NaN and infinities without scalar JSON or base64 conversion. Timeline, workspace,
upload and HTTP error responses remain JSON.
`status` is `running`, `failed`, or `success`. `commit_id` is null before publication;
a journaled failure also has a commit. `body` is null while running or failed and
contains only that action's typed scientific output on success.
`messages` is the sole execution-log accumulator: lifecycle entries, structured
progress, full LLM/tool traces, and failure details all remain there.

Poll `GET /api/studies/{workspace_id}/{action}/{call_id}`. GET only reads an existing
call; it never starts a workflow, executes an action, or retries a failure. Unknown
call IDs return 404. Identical resolved inputs reuse running calls and both successful
and failed completed calls, preserving the first request's reasoning.

Revision selectors accept exact Git hashes or `"latest"`. POST resolves selectors
once before computing `call_id`; GET keeps that selection when newer revisions appear.
Missing valid inputs return HTTP 422. `prepare_data` takes `input.source` as one
folder name under `data/{workspace_id}/`, such as `"input"`. Every file beneath
that folder, including subfolders, is captured and hashed before call identity.
Polling saved calls does not require the original source folder.
`edit_model` selects a question or model parent through `input.parent_ref`;
a question parent starts a new model; a model parent supplies its definition and pinned
question. The same DynamicalModelSpec accepts partial definitions: omission retains fields and null
entity entries delete their IDs. The editing boundary prunes outcome-unrelated components
with warnings and validates the assembled model. Every study starts with `edit_question`.

Each action owns its successful `body`; input state is read from its producing calls.
For `model_diff` and `data_diff`, `body` is the complete saved comparison.
Fit and simulation outputs include their own retained arrays and paths without paging.
Display summaries use null for missing values; numerical buffers retain native missingness.
Reports and checks are retained with their action in Git and never recomputed by GET,
including after cache deletion or code changes. Comparisons and failures remain
journal leaves without advancing scientific state.

`GET /api/studies/{workspace_id}/timeline` returns call IDs, retained requests,
outcome summaries, lifecycle messages, trace IDs, input dependencies and the running
call. The read-only web viewer follows recorded input dependencies and uses their call
IDs to compose saved results and logs. For example, a simulation reads its model
from the call named by its model dependency.
Agents create studies and submit actions directly to the facade.
`GET /api/workspaces` lists studies and questions; X-Actions-Enabled reports whether
new actions are enabled. `POST /api/upload` stages a named input file using
`multipart/form-data` with `workspaceId` and `file`.

With READ_ONLY_FACADE=1, existing calls remain readable. POST for an unsaved call
returns 403; GET for an unknown call returns 404.

## Endpoints

### POST `/api/studies/{workspace_id}/data_diff`

Compare input.left_ref and input.right_ref, each a nonempty list of {revision, replicate_index} references. Omit the index to compare all recorded histories. Data latest selects prepared user data; simulations require explicit gitrefs. Retain the complete comparison in Git. GET polls call_id. Identical resolved calls reuse successes and failures; the comparison is the body.

**Parameters**

- `workspace_id` (path, required)

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/studies/WORKSPACE_ID/data_diff" -o /tmp/action.msgpack \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action": "data_diff", "input": {"left_ref": [{"revision": "string"}], "right_ref": [{"revision": "string"}]}}'
```

### POST `/api/studies/{workspace_id}/edit_model`

Merge input.dynamical_model_spec into input.parent_ref: start empty for a question revision, or retain omitted fields from a model revision and its pinned question. Null entity entries delete their IDs. Prune constructs outside the outcome ancestry with warnings, then validate and evaluate data-independent model checks. The body contains the produced model and its findings; messages retain all execution logging. GET polls the returned call_id.

**Parameters**

- `workspace_id` (path, required)

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/studies/WORKSPACE_ID/edit_model" -o /tmp/action.msgpack \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action": "edit_model", "input": {"parent_ref": "string", "dynamical_model_spec": {}}}'
```

### POST `/api/studies/{workspace_id}/edit_question`

Set the study question from input.question. POST returns a call_id; GET polls it. Identical resolved calls reuse both successes and failures.

**Parameters**

- `workspace_id` (path, required)

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/studies/WORKSPACE_ID/edit_question" -o /tmp/action.msgpack \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action": "edit_question", "input": {"question": {"text": "string", "outcome": "string"}}}'
```

### POST `/api/studies/{workspace_id}/fit`

Condition input.dynamical_model_spec_ref on the history selected by input.data_ref.revision and input.data_ref.replicate_index. Zero selects prepared user data; a simulation index selects one recorded draw. GET polls call_id. The body retains model, checks and inference. Model laws own their numerical arguments; inference owns native telemetry.

**Parameters**

- `workspace_id` (path, required)

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/studies/WORKSPACE_ID/fit" -o /tmp/action.msgpack \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action": "fit", "input": {"dynamical_model_spec_ref": "string", "data_ref": {"revision": "string", "replicate_index": 0}}}'
```

### POST `/api/studies/{workspace_id}/model_diff`

Compare input.before_ref and input.after_ref as saved DynamicalModelSpec documents. Return changes using the same partial DynamicalModelSpec contract as edit_model: omissions are unchanged and null map entries delete identities. Retain the patch in Git. GET polls call_id. Identical resolved calls reuse successes and failures; the comparison is the body.

**Parameters**

- `workspace_id` (path, required)

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/studies/WORKSPACE_ID/model_diff" -o /tmp/action.msgpack \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action": "model_diff", "input": {"before_ref": "string", "after_ref": "string"}}'
```

### POST `/api/studies/{workspace_id}/prepare_data`

Prepare observations from uploaded tables using the selected model's definitions.

The source is a folder under ``data/{workspace_id}/``, including subfolders.
CSV and Parquet tables must supply a date or datetime timestamp column and
are concatenated in captured file order. Source bytes and revision selectors
are pinned before computing call identity.

Args:
    workspace_id: Study workspace containing the source folder and revision
        history.
    body: Preparation request selecting a model, source folder, and computed
        rules or semantic extraction instructions for its observation IDs.
    clients: Provider of the shared Temporal connection used to dispatch
        or retrieve the preparation workflow.

Returns:
    Current call status or a cached HTTP response for the same call. Polling
    by call ID exposes progress messages and, on success, the prepared
    observations and available profiles.

**Parameters**

- `workspace_id` (path, required)

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/studies/WORKSPACE_ID/prepare_data" -o /tmp/action.msgpack \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action": "prepare_data", "input": {"dynamical_model_spec_ref": "string", "source": "string", "extraction": {}}}'
```

### POST `/api/studies/{workspace_id}/simulate`

Simulate input.dynamical_model_spec_ref using input.simulation. The model owns deterministic inputs and retained trajectory coordinates; authored initial states apply at simulation.start. body.data contains an array of observation histories of the same type returned by prepare_data. The successful body requires data and report; report owns single or paired numerical evidence, calculated summaries and causal findings; messages retain traces. GET polls call_id.

**Parameters**

- `workspace_id` (path, required)

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/studies/WORKSPACE_ID/simulate" -o /tmp/action.msgpack \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action": "simulate", "input": {"dynamical_model_spec_ref": "string", "simulation": {"start": "string", "horizon": "string"}}}'
```

### GET `/api/studies/{workspace_id}/timeline`

Slim call log: call IDs, retained arguments, outcome summaries and dependencies. The viewer reads complete results and messages with GET using each call_id.

**Parameters**

- `workspace_id` (path, required)

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/studies/WORKSPACE_ID/timeline"
```

### GET `/api/studies/{workspace_id}/{action}/{call_id}`

Read an existing call by ID. Never resolve inputs, start a workflow, execute, or retry. The envelope and accumulated messages match POST, including cached failures.

**Parameters**

- `workspace_id` (path, required)
- `action` (path, required)
- `call_id` (path, required)

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/studies/WORKSPACE_ID/ACTION/CALL_ID" -o /tmp/action.msgpack
```

### POST `/api/upload`

Stage one named raw input file for prepare_data; that call captures its SHA-256.

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/upload" \
  -X POST \
  -F "file=@/path/to/file" \
  -F "workspaceId=WORKSPACEID"
```

### GET `/api/workspaces`

Available workspaces and their immutable study questions.

X-Actions-Enabled reports whether the facade accepts new calls.

```bash
curl -s "${TOOL_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}/api/workspaces"
```
