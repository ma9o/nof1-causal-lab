## Route by Question

| Question | Open first |
|---|---|
| What does this transition emit? | The relevant file under `pipeline/` |
| What does this artifact mean? | The artifact doc that introduces it |
| What assumptions constrain that artifact? | The matching page under `reference/` |
| How does time work across extraction, fitting, and interventions? | [reference/pipeline-dimensions.md](reference/pipeline-dimensions.md) |
