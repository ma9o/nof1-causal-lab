# Agent Quickstart

The service is headless: an external LLM agent navigates the episode machine
over HTTP, and the web viewer renders artifact versions selected by the
append-only transition log. This guide is the agent-side setup.

## Start the service

```bash
bun run integration:start
```

This brings up the Temporal dev server (port `7233`), the episode worker, the
tool server with the episode facade (port `8100`), and the web viewer (port
`3000`). See [agentic_integration_testing.md](agentic_integration_testing.md)
for details.

LLM-backed transitions read the ambient `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from the service's
environment — credentials are infra config, never per-move parameters.

## Drive the machine

The interface is plain HTTP — the same tool server the web viewer uses
(`TOOL_SERVER_URL`, default `http://localhost:8100`). There is no SDK and no MCP
server; an agent navigates entirely with `curl`.

An agent working in this repo gets the `nof1-episode-api` skill automatically —
Claude Code loads it from `.claude/skills/` (a symlink) and Codex from
`.agents/skills/`. Its [`SKILL.md`](../../.agents/skills/nof1-episode-api/SKILL.md)
is the full reference: every endpoint, its body shape, and a copy-ready `curl`
line, generated from the tool server's
[OpenAPI spec](../../packages/api-types/schemas/openapi.json) so it never drifts
from the API. The loop in brief:

1. `GET /api/machine` once for the artifact graph and creation classes, then
   `GET /api/episodes/{workspace_id}` for the live state and legal moves.
2. Propose moves at `POST /api/episodes/{workspace_id}/moves`: `run` an
   named operation for compute, or submit a complete scientific Model through
   `PUT /api/episodes/{workspace_id}/model` with its expected version.
   After inference, use the [runtime analysis tools](../pipeline/analysis.md) for scenarios.
3. Long transitions (`statistical_model_spec`, `posterior`) can outlive a client timeout: prefer
   `POST /api/episodes/{workspace_id}/auto`, then poll
   `GET /api/episodes/{workspace_id}`.
4. Read outcomes from `GET /api/episodes/{workspace_id}/timeline` — a `raised`
   transition carries the typed error; state is unchanged, so re-running is just
   proposing again.

Raw data enters by placing files under `data/{workspace_id}/input/` before
running the `raw_data` transition. The [integration testing guide](agentic_integration_testing.md)
has end-to-end curl walkthroughs of the same flows.

## Publishing a workspace

The hosted viewer is read-only and serves exactly what was deliberately
published to the hosted store:

```bash
uv run --project apps/data-pipeline nof1-publish WORKSPACE_ID \
  --exclude raw_data --exclude input
```

Publishing is an idempotent file copy (the store is append-only), so
re-running it during a live episode gives the hosted viewer a live tail.
Raw N-of-1 data is personal data — exclude it unless the workspace is
synthetic.
