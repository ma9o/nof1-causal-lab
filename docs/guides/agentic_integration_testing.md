# Agentic Integration Testing

## Design Principles

| Concern | Mode | Why |
|---------|------|-----|
| File placement, episode moves, run registration | **Programmatic** (`curl`) | Reliable, fast, no UI fragility |
| Runtime errors, route discovery, build state | **Next.js devtools MCP** | Reads the running app directly and catches server/runtime errors before UI debugging |
| UI rendering verification, visual regression | **browser automation** (`browser_eval` / Playwright) | Only way to see rendered output |

## Prerequisites

### Test cost

`bun run --cwd apps/data-pipeline test` and direct `uv run pytest tests/` runs
use one worker and exclude `slow`, `cpu_expensive`, and `gpu` tests by default.
Mark tests that compile numerical inference kernels, fit models, or run batches
of forward simulations with `@pytest.mark.cpu_expensive`. This marker applies
regardless of the device executing the numerical work. Mark tests that require
GPU hardware with `@pytest.mark.gpu`; retain `slow` for other long-running tests.
Contract, identity, projection, and small array-reduction tests remain in the
default selection.

Expensive tests require an explicit request. When authorized, select the desired
marker with `-m`; `test:all` explicitly includes every marker. Worker parallelism
also requires an explicit `-n` override.

### Local stack

```bash
bun run integration:start
```

Starts the stack under [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose)
supervision (`brew install f1bonacc1/tap/process-compose`; config:
[`process-compose.yaml`](../../process-compose.yaml)): the Temporal dev
server on port `7233` (ephemeral state, binary auto-downloaded on first
use), the episode worker (task queue `nof1-episodes`), the tool server
with the episode facade on port `8100`, and the web app on port `3000`.
Startup order is health-gated (`depends_on` + readiness probes) and
crashed processes restart automatically. The script **stays in the
foreground** — wait until `curl -s http://localhost:8100/api/capabilities`
answers before proceeding (pass `-t=false` to disable the TUI when
redirecting output to a file).

To tear down the stack, kill the script (`Ctrl+C`, or `kill <pid>` if
backgrounded). All child processes are cleaned up automatically.

The process-compose API is pinned to port `8181` for targeted operations
against the running stack:

```bash
process-compose --port 8181 process list
process-compose --port 8181 process restart worker
```

The worker caches `apps/data-pipeline/config.yaml` at first read
(`lru_cache`), so after editing pipeline config, restart the `worker`
process — no need to bounce the whole stack. The Temporal dev server
persists its event history to `.local/agentic-integration-stack/temporal.db`
(the `--db-filename` on its command), so restarting the `temporal`
process — to serve the UI, pick up a change, or recover from a crash —
**resumes** in-flight episode workflows exactly where they left off
rather than orphaning them. To start genuinely fresh, delete that
`temporal.db` before boot and wipe that workspace's `store/`, `episode/`,
`scratch/`, and `cache/` directories. The Web UI is served at
`http://localhost:8233`.

## Workspace Layout

```text
data/
├── <WORKSPACE_ID>/        # User-facing workspace
│   ├── input/             # Raw uploaded files for the raw_data transition
│   ├── store/             # Versioned artifact store ({artifact}/v{N}/)
│   ├── episode/           # Durable transition journal and promoted LLM traces
│   ├── cache/             # Evictable admission and compilation reuse
│   └── scratch/           # UI telemetry and run-scoped execution/checkpoints
└── DEMO/                  # Tracked mock fixture workspace (evals + manual sampling)
```

### Promoting a workspace to the DEMO fixture

Keep ordinary data workspaces and the committed fixture separate. Once a candidate
workspace has a complete, fresh artifact chain, promote it explicitly:

```bash
bun run fixture:promote --from <WORKSPACE_ID>
```

The command validates the episode journal, copies the durable workspace into
`data/DEMO`, and rebuilds stable JSON and trace copies under `data/DEMO/fixture/`
for Storybook and tests. It replaces `data/DEMO` as a unit rather than merging,
and excludes `cache/` and `scratch/`.

Artificial projections may temporarily fill artifacts that the checked-in DEMO
episode has not materialized. They belong only under `data/DEMO/fixture/`; the
next successful promotion replaces them automatically.

Regenerate the deterministic artificial completion from DEMO's real latent and
measurement structures, validation profiles, and panel with:

```bash
bun run fixture:demo
bun run fixture:demo:check
```

This leaves `data/DEMO/store/` and the episode journal untouched. Inside the
fixture only, it selects a compact scientific DAG and reduced indicator set
from the stored DEMO proposal, projects the corresponding validation audits,
grounds `known_inputs` and `scientific_only_constructs`, and rebuilds the causal
design through the production identification and structural-plan paths. It then
writes the missing downstream artifact and trace projections. Raw data and
extracted measurement values remain unchanged. Generation passes the production
artifact models, model-spec semantic validator and compiler, and simulate
input/output contracts; the original upstream validation report, including its
failures, remains in `data/DEMO/store/`.

## Step-by-Step Flow

### 1. Create the workspace and start the run

```bash
WORKSPACE_ID="T3ST42"
QUESTION="How does screen time affect sleep?"

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload \
  -F "workspaceId=$WORKSPACE_ID" \
  -F "file=@data/DEMO/input/dsar_bundle.zip"

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/runs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"workspaceId\":\"$WORKSPACE_ID\",\"query\":\"$QUESTION\"}"
```

There is no auth: the facade is the source of truth for what is allowed, and
`curl -s http://localhost:8100/api/capabilities` reports whether the move
plane is available (`moves_enabled` is `false` on a read-only facade).

This writes the `question` artifact and starts the **auto-run driver**: a
default navigation policy that proposes artifact-named `run` moves in dependency
order while transition outputs are missing or stale, stopping when the episode
is quiescent or a move fails.

### 2. Observe the episode

The episode facade (tool server, port `8100`) is the source of truth:

```bash
# Current state: artifact existence/staleness/versions + legal moves
curl -s http://localhost:8100/api/episodes/$WORKSPACE_ID | jq '.artifacts'

# The transition journal: every move attempt (applied / rejected / raised)
curl -s http://localhost:8100/api/episodes/$WORKSPACE_ID/timeline \
  | jq '.transitions[] | {seq, status, move, error_type}'

# Transition telemetry (extraction worker fan-out, model-spec agent graph)
curl -s "http://localhost:8100/api/episodes/$WORKSPACE_ID/events" | jq '.events[-3:]'
```

### 3. Verify via browser automation

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/analysis/{WORKSPACE_ID}`, screenshot the progress bar, then poll and screenshot each artifact section as it completes through the final "Complete" badge.

The persistent model view lives at `http://localhost:3000/model/{WORKSPACE_ID}`: one causal model per workspace with the version scrubber across the top, the graph over the scoped details pane, and the journal as a conversation on the right. Select a scrubber tick to open that move's version scope and its time breakdown; double-click a tick to view the asset as it stood then.

If the UI behaves unexpectedly, check Next.js devtools MCP errors before debugging the browser script.

## Resuming After a Transition Failure

A failed transition run is a `"raised"` transition in the journal — artifact
state is unchanged, and the typed error plus diagnostics ride on the record:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8100/api/episodes/$WORKSPACE_ID/timeline \
  | jq '.transitions[] | select(.status=="raised") | {seq, move, error_type, error_message, resume}'
```

Re-running is just proposing the move again (the machine validates
enabledness; there is no window arithmetic):

```bash
# Run one transition
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8100/api/episodes/$WORKSPACE_ID/moves \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"move": {"kind": "run", "artifact_id": "statistical_model_spec"}}'

# Or resume the default policy (runs everything enabled and stale/missing)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8100/api/episodes/$WORKSPACE_ID/auto \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

The question does not need re-supplying: it is a versioned root artifact,
not a run parameter.

## Editing artifacts

A human/LLM edit is a `write` move: schema-validated, provenance-stamped,
and journaled. Editing `measurement_structure` fans out a recomputed
`causal_design` plus a positive `identification_report` when the composed
design has explicitly identified treatments;
downstream artifacts become **stale** (visible in `.artifacts`), and the
next auto-run recomputes exactly the stale suffix.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8100/api/episodes/$WORKSPACE_ID/moves \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "move": {"kind": "write", "artifact_id": "measurement_structure", "provenance": "human"},
    "payload": {
      "measurement_structure": {"model_clock": "1d", "indicators": [...]},
      "known_inputs": []
    }
  }'

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8100/api/episodes/$WORKSPACE_ID/auto \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

Through the web app, [`/api/replay`](../../apps/web/src/app/api/replay/route.ts)
performs the same write-then-auto sequence; an external agent proposes the
same moves over MCP (see the [agent quickstart](agent_quickstart.md)).

### Valid Run Artifact IDs

Dependencies are artifact-level; `GET /api/machine` exposes
`topological_artifact_order` and `topological_transition_order` from
[`machine/graph.py`](../../apps/data-pipeline/src/nof1_causal_lab/machine/graph.py).
The runnable transition ids are:

```text
raw_data → latent_structure → measurement_structure → measurements → statistical_model_spec → posterior → baseline_report
```

Note the machine is not a tape: any transition whose consumed artifacts exist
can run. `identification_report` and `panel` are produced only when their
findings are nonempty, so their absence structurally disables the fit chain.
