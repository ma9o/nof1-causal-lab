# Assumptions and limits

These are the scientific commitments behind every result: what the model can express, what identification assumes, and how far each output can be read. The [action charts](../README.md#documentation) show where each commitment is checked. [Likelihoods](reference/statistical-model-spec/likelihoods.md) and [parameters](reference/statistical-model-spec/parameters.md) list the supported laws.

## Model class

- Latent constructs evolve as a continuous-time stochastic differential equation. The drift sums expressions over states and coefficients. These include per-construct dynamics such as decay and restoring potentials, and per-edge mechanisms such as linear and saturating (Hill) effects. Products express moderation, so the drift is nonlinear in general. Diffusion is additive, and fitting and simulation support only Gaussian diffusion.
- Indicators are observed at discrete, possibly irregular times through indicator-specific [observation laws](reference/statistical-model-spec/likelihoods.md).
- `fit` targets this model with Euler–Maruyama transitions between consecutive prepared time points, using the true nonlinear drift and the true emission density. Linearization and Gaussian approximations only initialize the sampler, so the remaining approximation is time discretization.
- `simulate` and the automatic predictive checks integrate the same equation with a Diffrax solver. Fitted and simulated histories therefore carry different discretization error.
- Missing observations are masked out of the likelihood, which assumes the missing-data mechanism is ignorable.
- Each study is fitted on its own, with no pooling across subjects or studies. Static subject-level states ([A5](#a5-time-invariant-constructs-are-static-subject-level-states)) are therefore not random effects in the multilevel sense.

## Causal graph

The model is one connected DAG over constructs. A theorized common cause appears as an explicit latent confounder node; the graph has no bidirected edges. Indicators belong to their construct and never cause it.

Endogenous means modeled, with or without causal parents. Every latent construct is endogenous. Exogenous means given through direct exact readings, `Delta(v=state(x))`, with no dynamics, diffusion, initial law or noise coupling; it cannot be an effect.

| Role | Temporal status | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exogenous | Time-varying | Recorded dose, daily stressor count |
| Exogenous | Time-invariant | Exactly recorded baseline age |
| Endogenous | Time-varying | Mood, stress, sleep quality |
| Endogenous | Time-invariant | Latent person intercept, stable susceptibility |

Declared edges specify direct causal parents. Their [temporal interpretation](../apps/data-pipeline/src/nof1_causal_lab/utils/identifiability.py) follows the constructs’ temporal status.

The model is built to answer the study [question](../apps/data-pipeline/src/nof1_causal_lab/artifacts/question.py), which every study sets first. The question names its outcome and intervention targets by construct identity before any model exists, and every edited model must define them. Its outcome scopes execution: only the outcome's connected component is compiled, fitted and simulated, so the rest of the graph needs no prior laws. An unmeasured root is projected out as correlated noise or a shared baseline factor, except a confounder that blocks identification of an effect on the outcome, which must be measured or modeled before the model runs.

### A3. Markov dynamics

Time-varying endogenous states follow first-order Markov dynamics: the current state summarizes earlier history. Explicit delay equations and higher-order lags are not modeled. Residual autocorrelation can indicate missing state dynamics or confounders. First-order within-person dynamics are the standard starting point in [dynamic SEM](https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2017.1406803).

An input reading sets a constant level over its own window: the recorded point or mean value, or a count or sum divided by the window length in model days. That level holds until the next reading, including beyond the record. Preparation carries the last eligible reading into the first selected window; a missing starting value is an error, and standard-deviation readings are unsupported. Fit pins this replay on every grid point and assigns it no initial or transition density. Simulation replays the same panel in both arms; an input intervention overrides the record from its date until the next intervention. Copied inputs are omitted from simulation checks and data comparisons involving a simulation.

### A4. Acyclic within a time slice

Static relationships form a DAG. Relationships between evolving states connect successive slices in the identification graph, allowing dynamic feedback. Every evolving state has carryover, independently of its causal role or observation status.

### A4b. Effects between evolving states act through the drift

Edge mechanisms evaluate the current state in the continuous-time drift. A cross-slice arrow expresses state evolution; it does not impose a measurement-clock delay on those equations. Identification and the v2 graph retain the declared direct relationships. Same-time co-movement can arise from explicit latent confounders or diffusion correlation.

### A5. Time-invariant constructs are static subject-level states

A time-invariant construct keeps its initial value over the modeled window. It may be exogenous or endogenous, but its causes must also be time-invariant, because a changing cause cannot determine a fixed child. Static states separate stable between-person differences from within-person dynamics; failing to separate them [biases lagged effects](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0038889).

## Measurement

### A1. Reflective indicators

Each construct causes its indicators. Formative measurement, where indicators define the construct, is not supported. Indicators of one construct should therefore correlate, and removing one does not change the construct's meaning. Formative models suit composite indices rather than theoretical constructs; see [Diamantopoulos & Siguaw (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8551.2006.00500.x).

### A6. Indicator count sets how measurement error is handled

With two or more indicators, shared variance separates measurement error from construct variance; see [Bollen (1989)](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118619179). With one indicator, [A9](#a9-a-single-indicator-absorbs-measurement-error) applies. The distinction affects precision, not identifiability.

### A8. Indicator errors are independent over time

All temporal dependence belongs to the constructs, so indicators get no autoregressive structure. Serially correlated residuals signal misspecification, such as a clock that is too coarse, missing cross-loadings or dynamics in the measurement itself; see [Asparouhov, Hamaker & Muthén (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2017.1406803). Correlated indicator residuals are not supported.

### A9. A single indicator absorbs measurement error

A construct with one indicator is identified with that indicator: its loading is fixed, and measurement error merges into the structural noise. This is the standard fallback described by [Bollen (1989)](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118619179). Its coefficients can be attenuated toward zero. Prefer several indicators when attenuation matters.

## Time

Each prepared history has one origin for model day zero. For files, it is the explicit source-span start, or otherwise the earliest support boundary across the full panel. Selecting a different set of model indicators does not move it. The initial-state law applies at day zero, and fitting includes that point even when the first observation is later. Fit and simulation reports retain the known calendar instant.

A simulation replicate keeps its calendar timestamps and starts a new history: its origin is the source report's origin plus its first model time, and its model days restart at zero. Calendar-free histories remain explicitly calendar-free; any synthetic epoch is only a serialization convention. The [simulate chart](assets/action-flows/simulate.svg) defines how requested starts use the available initial states.

Historical fits migrated from the old anchor-based convention retain their original model coordinates and recorded calendar binding, including any support boundaries before day zero. Migration does not reinterpret their retained states or intervention times. A new fit uses its prepared panel's origin.

| Concept | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `measurement_clock` | The shared measurement interval and default authoring interval for persistence and effect priors. |
| `observation_window` | The support interval that one indicator value summarizes. It defaults to the clock and may differ per indicator. |
| `aggregation` | How a window is summarized, which fixes the value's support and anchor (next table). |
| `anchor_time` | Where the value attaches to the latent path. |
| `dt` | The time between consecutive prepared time points, including window boundaries. It scales each Euler–Maruyama step in `fit`. |
| Simulation window | See the [simulation contract](../apps/data-pipeline/src/nof1_causal_lab/artifacts/simulation.py) and [simulate chart](assets/action-flows/simulate.svg). |

| `aggregation` | What matters | Support | Anchor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mean` | Average level over the window | Interval | Window end |
| `sum` | Cumulative amount | Interval | Window end |
| `count` | Event frequency | Interval | Window end |
| `std` | Within-window instability | Interval | Window end |
| `last` | Most recent state | Point | Window end |
| `first` | Earliest state | Point | Window start |

These choices are substantive: a daily mean mood and an end-of-day mood encode different theories of what matters. Neither a point summary nor an exact (`Delta`) observation implies that a value persists between observations.

A simulation window, like each question query, has one calendar date, its `start`; the window lasts a `horizon`, and interventions sit `after` offsets from the start. The record's day zero places the start in model days: the fit's origin for fitted laws, otherwise the current panel's. Without a panel the start is day zero, so the initial-state law applies there.

A historical simulation start still uses the selected revision's current joint law, including later observations used to fit it. Changing `start` does not undo conditioning or restrict the simulation to information available at that date.

## Causal identification

Identification is checked separately for each treatment's effect on the question's outcome, using nonparametric do-calculus and the ID algorithm of [Shpitser & Pearl (2006)](https://aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-191.pdf). One unidentified effect does not affect the others. Linear instrumental-variable arguments are not accepted, because the nonlinear model does not make the linearity assumptions they need.

### A3a. Scope of the two-slice check

Identification concerns a specified intervention–outcome query. The temporal segment used to decide identification and the effect's response horizon are distinct. For periodic causal graphs with finite maximum direct and latent lag, [Jahn, Karnik & Schulman (2025), Theorem 1 and Algorithm 2](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.20172v1) bound the required past and give a finite procedure for deciding identification across all future outcome shifts. Their bounds depend on graph width and maximum lag; they do not establish universal two-slice sufficiency.

Identification of an appropriate interventional transition law can also support propagation to later outcomes: see [Dynamic Causal Networks, Theorem 1 and Section 4.1](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~gavalda/papers/gilles2017.pdf#page=8), under confounding confined within individual slices. That paper's “static hidden confounders” are slice-local; a persistent time-invariant confounder in this framework does not automatically satisfy that condition.

The [current identifier](../apps/data-pipeline/src/nof1_causal_lab/utils/identifiability.py) uses a fixed two-slice graph. It does not verify a sufficient-window bound or identify the interventional transition law required for the propagation result above. Its finding establishes identification within that truncated graph; extending it to the full temporal process requires assumptions or a proof that the implementation does not verify. A bounded check can support longer-horizon effects when that justification is supplied.

### A7. Identified measurement lets constructs count as observed

Under A1, A6 and A9 the construct covariance is identified from the indicators, so graph identification can treat constructs as observed. This is the two-step logic of [Anderson & Gerbing (1988)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411). It requires the graph and the measurements to come from the same model revision.

The graph users see stays a DAG with explicit latent confounders. Internally, the check unrolls it to two slices, projects it to an ADMG as in [Richardson & Spirtes (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1214/aos/1031689015), and runs y0's identification algorithm. The projection never leaves the check.

## Parameter anchors

Every retained construct has exactly one location anchor and one scale anchor. Any shift or rescaling of a latent state that the anchors leave free must be absorbed by exactly one free parameter group. Two such groups would create an exact likelihood ridge, and none would over-constrain the model. A model whose complete retained constructs break this invariant is refused.

A model whose free coefficients enter only through a sum, or only through a product, in every use cannot be constructed: the observed-data law depends only on that combination, so no data can separate them. Two linear mechanisms on one edge, `a·X + b·X`, are the common case. The [check](../apps/data-pipeline/src/nof1_causal_lab/models/coefficient_redundancy.py) expands each equation into terms and tests the rank of the linear and multiplicative forms exactly; it misses redundancies it cannot see and never reports one that is absent. Passing it is not an identifiability proof. Redundancy that depends on the data, such as a cause the record holds constant, is reported against the question instead, because an intervention can break it.

- **Location** is anchored by the first of these that applies:
  1. A standardized channel: a mean-centered Gaussian or Student-t identity-link indicator whose intercept is fixed at zero.
  2. A direct exact state observation, `Delta(v=state(x))`.
  3. For a time-invariant construct, a fixed initial mean.
  4. For an evolving construct, a complete restoring expression with a fixed center.

  Fixed means and centers need not be zero. Observation intercepts and thresholds are identified relative to the anchor; free latent-side locations require a standardized or exact state-observation anchor. The need to constrain competing location parameters follows the ctsem discussion in [Driver, Oud & Voelkle (2017)](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v077.i05).
- **Scale and sign:** the reference indicator's loading is fixed to ±1 by its polarity, the marker-variable convention of [Bollen (1989)](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118619179). A construct measured only by categorical indicators instead pins its first non-baseline slope to +1, following the nominal-response model of [Bock (1972)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02291411). Reference indicators are chosen in this order: continuous, ordinal, binary or count, then categorical.

Some parameter pairs are only weakly separated, and the invariant deliberately doesn't gate them. No diagnostic currently flags them either:

- transient versus equilibrium location when dynamics are slow;
- static baseline-factor SDs in a single-subject fit;
- observation dispersion versus latent volatility;
- diffusion correlation versus fast reciprocal edges under coarse sampling;
- Hill `Emax` versus `EC50` when the input never spans the half-saturation point.

## Numeric causal claims

`simulate` reports a numeric effect only when all of these hold:

- The treatment's effect on the question's outcome is identified within the [implemented graph check's scope](#a3a-scope-of-the-two-slice-check).
- The simulated model was conditioned by a committed production fit, using the particle engine with the nonlinear Euler–Maruyama target, and it matches that fit's record exactly.
- That fit passed its [convergence checks](assets/action-flows/fit.svg), within the [sampler diagnostics' limits](#reading-results). A fit that fails them still saves with a warning, and the model needs revising before its effects are reported.
- The simulated paths are finite.

Otherwise it still returns the generated histories and records why no effect is reported. Interventions are dated state assignments, after which the model's dynamics resume. Effects are reported for the question's outcome only. Certification covers the identified treatment and outcome; it does not add a separate identification proof for a general timed joint intervention.

Certification does not look at predictive checks or LOO. Read those before trusting a reported effect.

## Reading results

- **LOO**, when configured, estimates how well each measurement row is predicted from all other rows, including later ones; see [Vehtari, Gelman & Gabry (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-016-9696-4). It measures interpolation, not forecasting; forecasting needs [leave-future-out validation](https://doi.org/10.1080/00949655.2020.1783262), which is not implemented. LOO is omitted when the data contain exact observations, and LOO-PIT is not computed.
- **Predictive checks** of fitted laws against the panel they were fitted on are in-sample. A different panel revision does not prove the observations were held out. Neither case establishes held-out calibration.
- **Sampler diagnostics** cover parameters only: rank-normalized R-hat, bulk and tail ESS, and MCSE. Latent paths get no convergence diagnostics. All chains start near one Pathfinder mode, so R-hat cannot reveal a missed mode.
- **Calibration and recovery** are not automated. A `simulate` → `prepare_data` → `fit` round trip mixes sampler error with the gap between the Diffrax solver and Euler–Maruyama.
- **Prior sensitivity** is not measured: there is no power-scaling or posterior-contraction check.
- **The DT-to-CT diagnostic** compares the elementwise conversion of a linear reference matrix, built from the priors, with its matrix logarithm. Its warning says nothing about the full nonlinear system.
- **C3 resolvability** is a screen that compares `1 / decay` with the observation gaps and span. It is not a nonlinear relaxation analysis or an identification test.
- **Data pattern warnings**, such as dominant duplicate values or arithmetic sequences, flag possible fabrication; they do not prove it.
- **Question checks** compare each query with the model and the record. An intervention value outside an exactly read input's recorded range, or a record that holds the input constant, means the answer there comes from the model's assumptions, not from this person's data.
