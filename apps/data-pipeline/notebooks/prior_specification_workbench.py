    # Codex-driven production prior specification

    This is an **authoring workbench**, not another embedded agent. The `PROPOSALS` cell below
    is the judgment surface: Codex edits ordinary Python payloads, reads the resulting
    diagnostics, and revises them directly.

    Its primary purpose is to validate the authoring framework implemented in `src` by exercising
    it manually, one construct at a time, in isolation from the surrounding agent and workflow
    infrastructure. At each step, the human-guided authoring process is the reference against which
    we evaluate whether the production prompt exposes the right information and parameter surfaces,
    the compiler interprets the proposal correctly, and the admission diagnostics lead toward a
    scientifically defensible revision. A rejected proposal is not automatically an authoring
    mistake: it may instead reveal a framework bug, an unnecessarily restrictive authoring surface,
    or misleading guidance.

    Everything after input loading is production code. Each payload goes through
    `ConstructBuildState.submit_construct`, so parameter membership, likelihood compatibility,
    compiler binding, exact nonlinear Diffrax prior prediction, and the C1--C5 reachability
    battery are the same ones used by Stage 4. Once all constructs are admitted, the notebook
    runs the same shared-draw full-model barrier. It uses the production immutable-checkpoint
    reducer and content-addressed admission-evaluation cache, but does **not** call Temporal,
    `ArtifactStore`, telemetry, or the Pi harness.

    The DEMO measurement-stage ModelSpec, panel, question, and validation report are read
    directly into memory. Each admission check derives a scoped ModelSpec and uses the
    production compiler. The stored artifacts are not mutated.

    ## Authoring protocol

    - Keep `N_DRAWS = 16` while discovering compiler or framework failures; use `200` for the
      production-strength replay and full-model barrier.
    - Append exactly one proposal at a time. If it is rejected, append a revised payload for the
      same construct; replay starts from a fresh state on every edit.
    - Before revising a rejected proposal, classify the failure: authored judgment error, framework
      bug, framework limitation, or misleading prompt/diagnostic.
    - Do not distort a scientifically defensible likelihood or prior merely to clear an admission
      check. If the framework is driving the author incorrectly, fix the production implementation
      in `src`, record the finding in the issue ledger, and replay the unchanged proposal first.
    - Accept a soft check only with its exact `(check, target)` pair and a substantive rationale.
      Hard checks are never overridden.
    - Do not author compiler defaults or parameters absent from the production prompt shown below.
    - Parameters marked conditional in the production prompt are authorable surfaces, not mandatory
      priors: include them only when the submitted family and link activate them.
    - Time-invariant observed quantities are conditioned on through the compiled known-input
      surface in this N-of-1 trial; they are not authored as latent state priors.

    ## New-trial framework issue ledger

    The prior replay's exact ordered-logistic location ridge is repaired in this run. Threshold and
    categorical channels no longer activate `manifest_mean_*`; auto-standardized continuous channels
    follow the same location-anchor rule. A second framework restriction surfaced when the
    internalizing construct combined 28-level PHQ-9, 22-level GAD-7, and four-level journal severity:
    the prompt exposed one global `obs_ordered_base` and `obs_ordered_gaps` prior for all three
    channels. That made the channel-specific category locations mutually incompatible. The
    production surface now exposes `obs_ordered_base_<indicator>` and
    `obs_ordered_gaps_<indicator>`. These bind to the relevant component or row of the existing
    vectorized runtime sites, so each indicator can express its own threshold geometry without
    changing the sampling topology.

    Exact measurements belong to indicator Delta laws. Required static-target chains
    remain unsupported and must be revised before this model can execute; removing a
    construct from the state vector is no longer an authored workaround.

    The first inference smoke on the nine admitted constructs exposed two runtime bugs and one
    unresolved capability gap. First, fit preflight read hydrated descriptor defaults instead of
    the compiled prior runtime actually sampled by inference; it therefore rejected the authored
    raw-scale fill-quantity intercept. Preflight now reads the compiled runtime bundle. Second,
    default automatic reparameterization turned LogNormal Hill parameters into nested
    `*_base_decentered` sites, but the particle runtime reconstructed only direct `*_decentered`
    sites. The resolver now applies both the base location-scale reconstruction and the outer
    distribution transform. A deliberately tiny point-only 60-day execution smoke then completed
    the exact Euler--Maruyama particle path and posterior extraction for all nine latent states.

    A subsequent Modal A100-80GB run exercised the same restricted model through the complete
    production configuration: four chains, 4,000 warmup steps and 1,000 retained draws per chain,
    64 latent particles, two parameter particles, Pathfinder initialization and preconditioning,
    and the exact Euler--Maruyama marginalized Particle Gibbs kernel. The 459-dimensional parameter
    bundle compiled, all eight Pathfinder starts were finite, and inference produced 4,000 posterior
    draws plus latent paths of shape `(4, 1000, 10, 9)`. The inference transition took 693.6 seconds;
    inference plus posterior predictive checks took 760.6 seconds. The persisted run is
    `nof1-nine-construct-inference-results:/20260720T134757+0000`.

    This run also exposed a posterior-predictive runtime bug: posterior samples contain the raw
    ordered-logistic `obs_ordered_base` and `obs_ordered_gaps` sites, while the emission compiler
    consumes their derived `obs_ordered_cutpoints`. Prior prediction assembled that derived site,
    but posterior prediction did not. Posterior prediction now uses the canonical site registry to
    assemble derived likelihood parameters after draw subsampling. The repaired production PPC
    completed and emitted six overcoverage warnings, each reporting that all observations fell
    inside a 95% predictive interval and that the model may be too diffuse.

    Completion is not convergence. Maximum split \(\hat R\) was 2.87, minimum bulk ESS was 2.75,
    and minimum tail ESS was 4.51. Mean parameter acceptance was 0.366 and mean latent update
    fraction was 0.403, but several adapted latent proposal scales collapsed to the configured
    \(10^{-5}\) floor. These diagnostics, together with the PPC warnings, reject this fit as a
    basis for numeric or causal claims. They are evidence that production execution works for the
    restricted point-observation model and that the current sparse likelihood does not adequately
    identify its parameterization.

    Development reruns now use the canonical `scripts/cached_fit.py` Modal runner. Its JAX cache is
    persistent, and its content-addressed warmup artifact stores Pathfinder's selected Gaussian,
    exact chain initial positions, parameter preconditioner, and IEKS reference trajectories before
    particle MCMC begins. The cache fingerprint includes the complete compiled artifact, panel,
    source environment, and warmup policy, while deliberately excluding posterior sample budgets
    and particle count. This keeps iterative fits fast without reusing initialization after a
    structural, prior, data, code, seed, or warmup-policy change.

    Both inference runs are execution checks, not inferential results. The tiny local smoke used one
    warmup step, one draw, and three particles; the production-config run used the complete sampler
    budget, but both withheld the four interval-summary channels
    (`state_of_mind_valence`, `escitalopram_fill_quantity`,
    `missed_or_extra_escitalopram_dose_mentions`, and
    `external_stressor_event_count`). The unmodified nine-construct model still cannot enter the
    production particle sampler because interval-summary observations are rejected. Supporting
    those emissions in the exact particle likelihood is therefore the remaining blocker before a
    scientifically meaningful limited-model fit.
