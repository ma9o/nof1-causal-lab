"""Architectural guard: linearization is confined to particle-sampler init.

Project invariant (see AGENTS.md / the SSM design): the continuous-time model is
nonlinear and the framework must never *assume* linearizability on any path that
produces a reported result. The one sanctioned use of the linearised IEKS/Laplace
marginal-likelihood backend is to *initialise* the particle samplers — initial
parameter positions, the proposal preconditioner, and the cSMC reference path.

This test fails if the linearised Laplace backend leaks out of that init/warmup
allowlist (e.g. into a counterfactual, predictive, estimate, or diagnostic path).
It is a static import scan — no JAX, no model build.
