"""Read-only study facade: the hosted viewer's entire backend.

Serves the same saved action results, slim timeline, workspace list and cached
model comparisons as the full tool server. Deployments set READ_ONLY_FACADE=1
so unsaved writing calls and uploads return 403. No Temporal connection, LLM
execution, fit or simulation is started by a saved call or model comparison.

Deployed as a Modal ASGI app (see :mod:`nof1_causal_lab.actions.modal_runners`),
or run locally::

    READ_ONLY_FACADE=1 uv run uvicorn --factory \
