"""Read-only episode facade: the hosted viewer's entire backend.

Serves the same journal-backed read endpoints as the full tool server —
same code, same projections — against whatever store the environment
selects (R2 in production), without importing the tool-execution/SSM
stack. Deployments set ``EPISODE_FACADE_READ_ONLY=1`` so the move plane
403s and ``/api/capabilities`` advertises ``actions_enabled: false``; no
Temporal, no tool execution, no LLM anywhere. A published workspace is
viewable (including live, while a local service is still writing to it)
without any hosted stateful service.

Deployed as a Modal ASGI app (see :mod:`nof1_causal_lab.flows.modal_runners`),
or run locally::

    EPISODE_FACADE_READ_ONLY=1 uv run uvicorn --factory \
        nof1_causal_lab.read_facade:create_read_facade_app --port 8100
