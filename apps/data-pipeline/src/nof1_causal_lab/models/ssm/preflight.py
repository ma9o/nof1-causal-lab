"""Fit-time consistency checks between observed data, spec, and priors.

The semantic pipeline layers (model-spec auto-standardization, prior-predictive
scale gates) only protect models that pass through them. Callers that drive
``inference.fit()`` directly — benchmarks, notebooks, manual runs — can hand
the sampler a configuration whose ground truth has essentially zero prior
density (e.g. a raw-scale Gaussian indicator mean of 87 under the canonical
``Normal(0, 2)`` manifest-mean prior). The posterior then concentrates on the
best compromise reachable within the priors and every coupled coordinate
distorts to absorb the misfit, which is indistinguishable from a sampler
failure in recovery summaries.

These checks run unconditionally at the ``fit()`` boundary and fail loudly:

- A channel marked ``manifest_standardized`` must actually arrive standardized
  (column mean near 0 and column sd near 1).
- A free manifest mean on an unstandardized identity-link location channel must
  have the observed column mean within reach of its prior.

Scope is deliberately limited to checks that cannot false-positive on a
legitimately authored model: fixed manifest means, non-identity links, and
non-location families are not judged here — scale plausibility for those
configurations belongs to the prior-predictive checks.
