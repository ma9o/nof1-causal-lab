"""Moves, legality, transition application, staleness, freshness.

The machine mutates only through artifact-named moves: ``run(artifact)`` for a
transition's primary output, or ``write(artifact)`` for roots and writable
judgment artifacts. Run legality is existence-only over declared inputs. Write
legality is schema/provenance-bound and the write executor owns any derivation
cascade that must complete before the move can become current.

Freshness is a derived query over version pins, not a stored flag. Produced and
written artifacts can be stale; derived artifacts are maintained by the cascade
and are either current or absent on the public surface.
