"""Temporal shell: the thin durable layer around the pure machine.

One entity workflow per episode holds the ``EpisodeState`` and exposes
``propose`` (update) / queries; activities execute stage runs and writes
against the artifact store and project every transition attempt into the
episode journal. All validation delegates to the pure functions in
:mod:`nof1_causal_lab.machine.moves` — the workflow adds durability, not
semantics.
