"""Typed transition exceptions.

Discriminator: an exception means the transition FAILED TO EXECUTE ITS
CONTRACT — state must not change, and the failure is a property of the
attempt (recorded in the transition log), never of the world. Negative
findings (no estimable treatments, zero observations extracted) are NOT
exceptions: those transitions succeed and simply withhold their enabling
artifact while producing a report.

Temporal maps these to non-retryable ApplicationErrors; transient infra
failures (network, OOM, Modal preemption) stay as ordinary exceptions and
are retried by policy without the navigator ever seeing them.
