"""The artifact-level ruleset: how each artifact comes into existence.

Nodes are artifacts, not stages. An artifact enters the store exactly one of
three ways:

- **root** artifacts are written directly by a caller,
- **produced** artifacts are computed by running the transition keyed by the
  artifact it primarily creates,
- **derived** artifacts are deterministic machine-maintained nodes recomputed
  from their parents inside the same move that changed those parents.

Run legality is a pure existence check over a transition's ``consumes``. Derived
nodes are never runnable, never writable, and never stale: they move in lockstep
with their parents through the derivation cascade.
