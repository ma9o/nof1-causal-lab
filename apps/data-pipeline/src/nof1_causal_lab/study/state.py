"""Study state: the artifact versions a Git commit selects, and their freshness.

Git trees select immutable scientific artifacts. Each artifact records its input
tree OIDs, which identify the facts used by execution. StudyState is the
runtime projection of a selected commit tree.

These are pydantic models (frozen) rather than dataclasses because they
cross serialization boundaries verbatim: Temporal update/activity payloads
(via the pydantic data converter) and the tool-server facade's JSON API.
