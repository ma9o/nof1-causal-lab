"""The seven public actions, each with its input and successful output body.

HTTP inputs use ``RevisionSelector`` (an exact revision or ``"latest"``);
saved inputs use resolved ``GitOid`` values. ``prepare_data.source`` is a
``SourceFolder`` over HTTP and a captured ``FileSourceRef`` in saved inputs.

Request envelopes live in ``actions.contracts``. Each output becomes the
``body`` of the polling envelope in ``actions.results``.
