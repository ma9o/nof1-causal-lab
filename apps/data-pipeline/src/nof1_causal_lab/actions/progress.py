"""Live progress of a running attempt: extraction step events.

Events land as one JSON file each under ``data/{workspace_id}/scratch/events/`` (neither
local fs nor R2 supports atomic append); readers list the directory and sort by
filename, which is time-ordered by construction. Progress is disposable: the attempt
record and its traces are authoritative, and the sweep truncates the stream freely.
Every event names the attempt that emitted it, and each attempt reads only its own.
