"""Identifiability checking using y0's ID algorithm.

Uses Pearl's do-calculus via y0 to check if causal effects are identifiable
given observed/unobserved constructs. This properly handles:
- Backdoor criterion
- Front-door criterion
- Instrumental variables (under a parametric linearity assumption; gated by ``iv_allowed``)
- Other identification strategies from Shpitser & Pearl

Design principle: Users specify DAGs with explicit latent confounders. We convert
to ADMG internally using y0's from_latent_variable_dag() for identification.

Note on IV: y0's nonparametric do-calculus cannot identify effects via IV alone.
``check_identifiability`` can additionally report graph-theoretic IV candidates
when the caller explicitly allows the parametric linearity assumption. The default
returns only nonparametric do-calculus identifications. Nonlinear ModelSpec
authoring and causal reporting do not permit the linear-IV argument.

    2. Exclusion: Z is not an ancestor of Y when X's incoming edges are removed
       (Z affects Y only through X)
    3. As-if-random (Exogeneity): Z is not a descendant of any node that causes Y
       (Z is not affected by confounders of the X-Y relationship)

    This enables IV identification under linear SEM assumptions, even when
    y0's nonparametric do-calculus says the effect is not identifiable.
