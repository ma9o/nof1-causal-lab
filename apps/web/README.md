# Web Frontend

Next.js app for session management and pipeline stage visualization. Part of the [nof1-causal-lab](../../README.md) monorepo.

```bash
bun run dev    # Start dev server on port 3000 if one is not already running
bun run build  # Production build
bun run test   # Vitest unit tests
```

In this repo's shared dev workflow, the web dev server is often already running on port `3000`. Reuse that server when possible; do not start a second copy from the same worktree. For runtime diagnostics, prefer the Next.js devtools MCP (`get_errors`, `get_routes`, `get_project_metadata`) over ad hoc browser-only checks.

Server-side routes default to local pipeline services:

- `TOOL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8100`

All pipeline interaction goes through the tool server's study facade (`/api/studies/...`): the viewer polls the study status and attempt journal, and a running data preparation's live progress from its attempt's event stream.

OpenRouter web access uses these server-side env vars:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for anonymous local web execution and direct pipeline execution
- `APP_SECRET` to derive the encrypted OpenRouter session cookie secret and BYOK handoff secret (minimum 32 characters)
- `OPENROUTER_CREDITS_API_KEY` for optional trial credit inspection
- `BYOK_SECRET_STORE_URL` for the OpenRouter ref store; defaults to `file:.local/byok-secret-store.db` locally and can point at `libsql://...` in deployed environments
- `BYOK_SECRET_STORE_AUTH_TOKEN` for remote libSQL/Turso deployments

The web app reads those keys from the runtime environment first, then falls back to the monorepo root `.env` for local development. `APP_SECRET` is required anywhere the web app needs to manage OpenRouter sessions or mint BYOK handoff refs. In local dev and CI, the web app and pipeline share the same file-backed libSQL database for single-use OpenRouter handoff refs. In deployed environments, both services can point that same store at Turso with the same URL and token.
