/**
 * Time-unrolling for the causal-DAG renderers (shared by the static structure
 * DAG and the analysis interactive DAG).
 *
 * A lagged dependency — something at t−1 driving an effect at t — is drawn by
 * *unrolling time* rather than merely tagging the edge: the t−1 source becomes
 * a faded "ghost" copy of the present node and the edge runs ghost → present.
 * A contemporaneous dependency stays present → present. State persistence is a
 * separate ghost → matching-present self edge. This mirrors the backend's
 * 2-timestep unrolling for identification.
 *
 * This module owns only the cross-consumer *convention* (the `__p` id suffix,
 * the ghost fade, and the ghost→present link builder). It is deliberately NOT
 * in `core/`: the core renderer is domain-agnostic (plain `{nodes, edges}`),
 * whereas which constructs are time-varying and which self-dynamics have
 * materialized is a domain decision each consumer makes.
