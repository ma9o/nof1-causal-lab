**nof1-causal-lab** is an opinionated LLM harness for end-to-end Bayesian causal inference on N-of-1 time series data.

The ultimate goal of the project is to facilitate epistemically optimal decision-making at the individual level, using dense digital trace datasets (medical records, chatbot conversation logs, browsing history, etc.) while transparently incorporating existing scientific knowledge, where available, in the form of prior distributions and modeling assumptions.

The user supplies a scientific question and observational data. The framework exposes four scientific actions: [edit the model](docs/assets/action-flows/edit-model.svg), [prepare data](docs/assets/action-flows/prepare-data.svg), [fit](docs/assets/action-flows/fit.svg), and [simulate](docs/assets/action-flows/simulate.svg). Constructs, causal structure, measurements, fixed or estimable parameters, and probability laws can be revised together or incrementally. Applicable specification and data checks run on submission. Fitting conditions the selected continuous-time nonlinear state-space model; simulation samples its current laws before or after fitting. [Numeric causal claims](docs/assumptions.md#numeric-causal-claims) require identification and matching evidence from a converged production fit.

In practice, the framework is designed for longitudinal consumer datasets that are easily accessible via data subject access requests (DSARs), from more domain specific ones like Apple Health, Oura, 23andMe, Strava (cardiometabolic health, chronic conditions, performance & adaptation), Anki, Duolingo, YouTube (education & deliberate practice) to more cross cutting ones like Google Takeout, WhatsApp, ChatGPT/Claude logs (mental health, cognition & attention, habit & behavior change) - and, most interestingly, their intersections!

## Features and Goals

- **Methodological rigor without friction** - An user should be simply able to provide a dataset and a question, and the software should provide the most rigorous possible answer without pushing any methodological decision onto the user.
- **Interpretability and interactivity** - Every model revision, check and result is recorded and can be inspected in the UI; users challenge or override the agent's decisions in conversation with it.
- **Support for large datasets, irregular timestamps and semantic heterogeneity** - via a continuous-discrete nonlinear state-space model — continuous-time latent dynamics observed at discrete, irregular timestamps — with non-Gaussian indicator-specific likelihoods (Poisson, Bernoulli, Beta, etc.).
- **Incremental numerical modeling and prior elicitation** - model revisions can be small and interleaved; each edit reruns only the affected checks, including exact predictive checks against prepared data.
- **Fast and accurate parameter and state estimation in `jax`** - Exact inference in minutes using [parallel-in-time particle smoothing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14868) on GPU. Efficient caching ensures that we never waste time waiting for compilation.
- **Compatible with `codex` and `claude-code`** - Leverage your existing subscription, both for the agent that drives the study and for LLM-backed ingestion and extraction.

## Modeling

Causal identification on the SSM is achieved by temporal unrolling the DAG as per [Jahn et al. (2025)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v275/jahn25a.html) then running the [ID algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2008.12.006) on the unrolled segment for each treatment-outcome pair.

The system is a continuous-discrete nonlinear state-space model: the latent constructs evolve in continuous time as a stochastic differential equation, observed at discrete and possibly irregular times. The drift is a composite vector field — per-construct decay and intercepts plus linear, saturating (Hill), and bilinear edges — so the dynamics are nonlinear in general:

Observations follow indicator-specific likelihoods (see the supported [distribution families](docs/reference/statistical-model-spec/likelihoods.md#distribution-families) and [link functions](docs/reference/statistical-model-spec/likelihoods.md#link-functions)):

See [assumptions and limits](docs/assumptions.md) for the structural assumptions baked into the modeling framework and how far its results can be read.

## Quick Start

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
cd apps/data-pipeline && uv sync --frozen --group dev && cd ../..

# Environment — set OPENROUTER_API_KEY at minimum
cp .env.example.dev .env

# Start the web viewer and the tool server
# (bun run integration:start runs the full stack, including Temporal and the worker)
bun run dev
```

See the [dev setup guide](docs/guides/dev_setup.md) for full details including environment variables and optional dependencies.
